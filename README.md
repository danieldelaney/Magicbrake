# On the use of AI

Using AI to produce code can be interpreted almost as a political act. This is as good a place as any for my manifesto.

Good code is like poetry, or painting: the product of meditation which nourishes the soul. AI slop clearly does nothing to satiate that human need. Why use it, then?

Some code is solely instrumental. It begins not with “How might I express my inner yearning most completely?” but instead “How might I arrive at something functional in the least time possible?” This project is born of the latter impulse.

In short, hand coding is for savoring the work, and vibe coding is for automating that which one wishes was already done.
